# RadixSort-TextFile-DoublyLinkedList-CPP

This C++ project provides a solution for sorting disordered text archive files efficiently. It employs the radix sort method to organize the lines into a doubly linked list data structure. Radix sort, a non-comparative sorting algorithm, is applied to sort text lines character by character, ensuring stability and speed.

## Key Features

- Reads and extracts lines from a disordered text archive file.
- Implements a doubly linked list to store the lines.
- Applies the radix sort algorithm to sort lines character by character.
- Efficiently assembles the sorted lines into a doubly linked list.
- Writes the sorted lines to an output text file in C++.
